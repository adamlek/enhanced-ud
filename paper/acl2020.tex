\section{Introduction}
(ADAM)

Universal Dependencies is a syntactic annotation schema focusing
on representing shallow syntactic dependencies between words. One
of the goals of UD has been to use it in semantic downstream
tasks, such as X or Y. However, basic dependencies between words
contain many implicit dependencies related to the semantic
interpretation of a sentence.

To make the dependencies explicit the Enhanced Universal
Dependencies schema was created. The goal of the schema is to
make certain semantic dependencies more explicit, such as
conjoined subject and object. The enhanced dependencies include
additional edges between words, aswell as augmented labels. For
example in enhanced dependencies, the conjunction relation also
include what type of conjunction is used, \textit{and, or,
but} and so on.

In this paper we present our submission for the IWPT 2020 Shared
Task for parsing enhanced universal dependencies. We use a
tree-rewriting approach based on syntactic pattern in the basic
universal dependencies to derive ehanced dependencies.

We chose this approach because in many cases enhanced dependencies
are functions of the basic dependencies. Thus, our approach pose
the hypothesis:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Most information about EUD is contained in UD
\end{enumerate}

We explore this by applying our approach to gold UD trees and
observe how much of the enhanced dependencies are captured.

    
%General idea: as described by the website
%(https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/enhanced-syntax.html)
%for many cases, enhanced UD is a function of UD.
   
    
%Hypothesis: most information about EUD is already contained in UD.

In the shared task, teams are asked to produce enhanced
dependencies from raw texts in 17 different languages. The
majority of the languages are indo-european with some notable
exceptions such as Tamil (Dravidian) and Finnish (Uralic).

The task is evaluated using ELAS and EULAS scores. ELAS calculates
the $F_1$-score over all enhanced dependencies, the metric
include both edges and edge labels. A secondary metric, EULAS, is
used which calculates the $F_1$-score over the edges only.


    
-An interesting caviat to the shared task is that systems must produce basic dependencies in addition to the enhancements.  
    
-Describe task again.

-The task is evaluated using ELAS and EULAS score

    
-What is ELAS and EULAS  score.

-Implement the function for the common case, and see how we fare on the
-ELAS and EULAS  score.

Results in 2 lines:
- scores
- efficient
- transparent

\section{Method}

% stanford parser

In essence, our method is to apply the recipes provided by TODO to
transform simple UD \emph{trees} into EUD graphs.

For (TODO: this task) The simple UD trees we generated using the
Stanford UD Parser. (TODO: cite)

Then, we use a tree-matching procedure against the UD trees, and
locally insert edges corresponding to enhanced dependencies (and
sometimes delete unwanted edges). As a particular case, we may
re-label some edges. Once this is done, we convert the result back to
(enhanced) CONLL \todo{citation} format.

Perhaps surprisingly, the patterns that we need to recognize are
simple, involving only three nodes. The two patterns to recognised are
shown in \cref{fig:patterns}. Essentially, we need to match on three
connected nodes.  We need to identify types of paterns. First, two
arcs forming a two-step path
(\cref{fig:pat-nsubj-conj,fig:pat-obl,fig:pat-rel}). We refer to this
style pattern as ``Type 1''.  Second, with two arcs pointing away from
a central node (\cref{fig:pat-aux-conj,fig:pat-xcomp}), refered to as
``Type 2''.

\begin{itemize}
\item Type 1 pattern with a relation label, which can be any of
  ``nsubj",``obj", ``amod", ``advcl",``obl", ``mark", ``nmod", followed by a
  ``conj'' label. (\cref{fig:pat-nsubj-conj}.) In this case we add an
  edge with the relation label to the other conjunct.
\item Type 2 pattern with a a relation label being either ``nsubj'' or
  ``aux'', and a ``conj'' label. (\cref{fig:pat-aux-conj}.) We add a relation a relation label to
  the other conjunct, but only if the conjunct is not itself
  ``nsubj''. Indeed, if it were, then we are conjoining two full
  sentences and then there is no need for an enhanced dependency.
\item Type 2 pattern with ``xcomp'' and ``nsubj''. Here we add an
  "nsubj:xsubj" edge. (\cref{fig:pat-xcomp}.)
\item Type 1 pattern, with ``acl:relcl" followed by a relation label
  which can be either ``nsubj",``obj",``obl",
  "advmod". (\cref{fig:pat-rel}.) The target node should also be a
  \emph{relative} pronoun, ie. it POS is ``PRON'' and its XPOS either
  ``WP'' (who, whom) or ``WDT'' (that, which). Indeed, this pattern is
  also found with other type of pronouns, but then it does not
  correspond to a relative clause.  In this case we add a ref edge to
  the pronoun and a (reverse) relation edge between the first and
  second node. The original relation edge is deleted.\todo{check}
\item Type 1 pattern, with a conjunction followed by a case
  marking. (\cref{fig:pat-obl}.) Exhaustively, the type of labels are ``case" followed by
  ``obl" or ``nmod"; ``cc" followed by ``conj", ``mark" followed by ``advcl"
  or ``acl". In this case we enhance the label with the lemma of the target node.
\end{itemize}
In all cases, we have additional constraints on the
(edge) labels. For Type 1, the relation can be either nsubj or aux

The results indicate that our system is more successfull at
finding the dependency edges compared to the dependency
labels. One large benefit of our system is that while it does
produce less than perfect output, in most cases the system may be
augmented such that these instances can be handled correctly.

TODO: what is the baseline (just deleting enhanced dependencies from the gold files)? (no official baseline... yet)

\section{Discussion/Analysis}


It works well on gold.
Performance on data is driven by quality of ..

Labels work for english but not well for all languages.

Secondary hyp: EUD do not help for learning EUD.

We do not know about this YET. For this we'd need to use compare a
state of art UD implementation.


To test that we'd need to run our system on the \emph{training} data
of a state of the art EUD system and see how that affects its
performance. But we can't do it since such systems are not available
yet (this is the purpose of the task ...).

Also can be used for bootstrapping.

Also: we provide a kind of a baseline.
