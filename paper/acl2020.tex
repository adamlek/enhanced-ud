\section{Introduction}
% UD intro
Universal Dependencies (UD) is a syntactic annotation schema
focusing on representing shallow syntactic dependencies between
\emph{words}. One of the goals of UD has been to use it in
semantic downstream tasks, such as event extraction
\citep{fares20182018, mcclosky2011event} \todo{which tasks} or
negation resolution \citep{fares20182018}.
%
However, the UD format restricts the shape of dependencies to a tree
structure.  This can be limiting, because semantics dependencies can
in principle exhibit any graph structure.

% EUD intro
To remedy this situation, the Enhanced Universal
Dependencies (EUD) schema was created. The goal of the schema is
to make certain semantic dependencies more explicit, such as
conjoined subject and object. The enhanced dependencies include
additional edges between words, aswell as augmented labels. For
example in enhanced dependencies, the conjunction relation also
include what type of conjunction is used, \textit{and, or, but}
and so on.

% What we do in this paper
In this paper we present our submission for the IWPT 2020 Shared
Task for parsing enhanced universal dependencies. The goal of the
task is to produce EUD graphs for all the basic dependency trees
in a set of treebanks from UD version 2.5.\todo{what is the treebank?}.

This paper proposes to test the following hypothesis:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(H1)] Most of the information provided by the EUD schema is
  contained in the UD schema.
\end{enumerate}

That is, if (H1) holds, then it is possible to map, algorithmically,
UD trees to EUD graphs.

Thus, we set out to implement such a map. Concretely, we construct  a
tree-to-graph transformation, which recognizes patterns in the (basic)
universal dependencies to derive enhanced dependencies.

More precisely, by running our algorithm on representative gold UD
data, we will be able to get a \emph{lower bound} on the amount of EUD
information contained UD (for these representative inputs).

Additionally, by running our algorithm after a state-of-the-art UD
parser, we will provide a baseline for the EUD reconstruction task.

%General idea: as described by the website
%(https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/enhanced-syntax.html)
%for many cases, enhanced UD is a function of UD.

% Shared task introduction
Indeed, in the IWPT shared task, teams are asked to produce enhanced
dependencies from raw texts in 17 different languages. The
majority of the languages are indo-european with two notable
exceptions, Tamil (Dravidian) and Finnish (Uralic).

The task is evaluated using two metrics, ELAS and EULAS. ELAS
calculates the $F_1$-score over all enhanced dependencies, the
metric include both edges and edge labels. A secondary metric,
EULAS, is used which calculates the $F_1$-score over the edges
only.


% results in two lines
Our results show that (H1) is vindicated: we achieve an ELAS score of
$96.70$ and EULAS of $81.55$ on human-annotated dependency trees.  As
a baseline for the shared task, our method is also effective,
achieving an ELAS score of $67.85$ and an EULAS score of
$80.18$. (Thus loosing about $15$ percentage points when going through
a a machine-generation phase to obtain UD trees.)

\section{Method}
In essence, our method is to apply the tree rewrite recipies
provided in \citep{schuster2016enhanced} to transform basic UD
\emph{trees} into EUD graphs.


To obtain basic UD trees for our system we use the universal
dependency treebanks provided by the shared task organizers. From
these we apply our method on basic UD trees from two sources:
\begin{itemize}
\item for each treebank we use the Stanford Biaffine Dependency
Parser \citep{dozat2016deep} provided in Stanza
\citep{qi2020stanza}.
\item
the development and gold trees in the treebanks, minus the enhanced
dependencies.
\end{itemize}

Then, we use a tree-matching procedure against the UD trees, and
locally insert edges corresponding to enhanced dependencies (and
sometimes delete unwanted edges). As a particular case, we may
re-label some edges. Once this is done, we convert the result back to
(enhanced) CONLL format.

Our system contain several patters described below. We first apply
all of the patterns that add or remove edges from the basic
tree. Here, we only apply the patterns on the basic tree and not
on enhancements made by any other pattern. After we've added the
new edges, we modify the edge labels and append the necessary
information.

Perhaps surprisingly, the patterns that we need to recognize are
simple, involving only three nodes. The two patterns to recognised are
shown in \cref{fig:patterns}. Essentially, we need to match on three
connected nodes.  We need to identify types of paterns. First, two
arcs forming a two-step path
(\cref{fig:pat-nsubj-conj,fig:pat-obl,fig:pat-rel}). We refer to this
style pattern as ``Type 1''.  Second, with two arcs pointing away from
a central node (\cref{fig:pat-aux-conj,fig:pat-xcomp}), refered to as
``Type 2''.
In both cases, we have additional constraints on the (edge) labels. Together, constraint
on graph topology and labels form patterns which we recognize and transform.
The exhaustive list of patterns and transformations follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Type 1 pattern with a relation label, which can be any of
  ``nsubj",``obj", ``amod", ``advcl",``obl", ``mark", ``nmod", followed by a
  ``conj'' label. (\cref{fig:pat-nsubj-conj}.) In this case we add an
  edge with the relation label to the other conjunct.
  %
  A full dependency tree containing this pattern can be found in \cref{fig:paul-and-mary}.
  \label{item:paul-and-mary}
\item Type 2 pattern with a a relation label being either ``nsubj'' or
  ``aux'', and a ``conj'' label. (\cref{fig:pat-aux-conj}.) We add a relation a relation label to
  the other conjunct, but only if the conjunct is not itself
  ``nsubj''. Indeed, if it were, then we are conjoining two full
  sentences and then there is no need for an enhanced dependency.
  %
  A full dependency tree containing this pattern can be found in \cref{fig:reading-or-watching}.
  \label{item:reading-or-watching}
\item Type 2 pattern with ``xcomp'' and ``nsubj''. Here we add an
  "nsubj:xsubj" edge. (\cref{fig:pat-xcomp}.)
\item Type 1 pattern, with ``acl:relcl" followed by a relation label
  which can be either ``nsubj",``obj",``obl",
  "advmod". (\cref{fig:pat-rel}.) The target node should also be a
  \emph{relative} pronoun, ie. it POS is ``PRON'' and its XPOS either
  ``WP'' (who, whom) or ``WDT'' (that, which). Indeed, this pattern is
  also found with other type of pronouns, but then it does not
  correspond to a relative clause.  In this case we add a ref edge to
  the pronoun and a (reverse) relation edge between the first and
  second node. The original relation edge is deleted. A full dependency
  tree of this pattern can be seen in \cref{fig:aclrecl}.
  \item Type 1 pattern, with a conjunction followed by a case
   marking. (\cref{fig:pat-obl}.) Exhaustively, the type of labels
   are ``case" followed by ``obl" or ``nmod"; ``cc" followed by
   ``conj", ``mark" followed by ``advcl" or ``acl". In this case we
   enhance the label with the lemma of the target node. This pattern
   can be seen in \cref{fig:rel-clause}.

TODO Adam: dependency tree for this:

- John came from Paris
- some sentence with a relative clause


For patterns \cref{item:paul-and-mary,item:reading-or-watching}, the
conjunction dependency could conceptually be inverted, yielding two
other patterns (shown in
\cref{fig:pat-nsubj-conj-bad,fig:pat-aux-conj-bad}). However, we have
not implemented these patterns in our system. For the first pattern,
the reason is simple: it is not representable as a UD tree (a node
cannot have two parents). For the second pattern, applying it
results in a small loss in performance accross the board \todo{can we
  run this ?}, and thus it is best left inactive.

\section{Results}
(ADAM)

We present our official results for the shared task in
\cref{tab:test}. The scores are obtained by applying our method
to dependency trees generated by the Stanford Dependency Parser.

The results indicate that our system is more successfull at
finding the dependency edges compared to the dependency
labels. One large benefit of our system is that while it does
produce less than perfect output, in most cases the system may be
augmented such that these instances can be handled correctly.

To find an upper bound of our approach we also apply it to the
human annotated dependency trees. We test our approach on both
the development and test data. The results from this experiment
is shown in \cref{tab:gold-data}.

%TODO: Add std dev.

Our results on gold trees again confirm that our system works best
for detecting edges, while the performance of edge labels is
lower. Comparing \cref{tab:test} and \cref{tab:gold-data} shows
that our approach is very dependent on the underlying parser. In
addition to the ELAS and EULAS score being higher, the standard
deviation is also much highrer for EULAS, $8.19$ in the test
versus $1.43$ on the gold data.
    
    
\section{Discussion/Analysis}

Our results indicate that our approach works well on the gold
trees. When we consider machine generated trees we see that our
performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the trees.
    
%It works well on gold.
%Performance on data is driven by quality of input trees also!

%Labels work for english, ..., but not well for languages with
%morphological case roles. 

% one of the causes for lower labels score
Our simple approach works best for Bulgarian, English, Italian,
Dutch and Swedish, which express case through syntax.  Indeed,
the pattern \cref{fig:pat-obl} recognize case based on a
preposition rather than a morphological feature. In the other
languages case is expressed by morphological features, and
require additional fine-tuning of the label enhancements.

    
% second problem for our approach on labels
Our system also struggle with labels that include multi-word
tokens. For example, a valid adverbial clause modifier is
\textit{so\_that}. To solve these label enhancements our system
would need either a complete list of multi-word tokens, or be
able to figure them out using statistical or deep learning    
    
    
Secondary hyp: EUD do not help for learning EUD.

We do not know about this YET. For this we'd need to use compare a
state of art UD implementation.


To test that we'd need to run our system on the \emph{training} data
of a state of the art EUD system and see how that affects its
performance. But we can't do it since such systems are not available
yet (this is the purpose of the task ...).

Also can be used for bootstrapping.

Also: we provide a kind of a baseline.

The hypothesis is can be refuted on some simple example:

She was reading or watching a movie.

Even though ``a movie'' is an object of a verb conjunct, it should not
be propagated. But in some other cases it should. And this depends on
the semantics and pragmatics, and our system will not be able to make
a difference between these cases.

She was cleaning and eating fruits.

%Our system will also struggle with multi-word labels such as:
%\textsc{advcl:so-that}. To solve these label enhancements a
%system would need either a complete list of these multi-word
%tokens, or be able to figure them out using statistical or deep
%learning

In addition to performing well, our approach is simple and efficient. and only
require a few seconds to generate enhanced graphs from a
treebank.
