\section{Introduction}
(ADAM)

In this paper we present an approach to producing enhanced universal
dependencies.

General idea: as described by the website
(https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/enhanced-syntax.html)
for many cases, enhanced UD is a function of UD.

Hypothesis: most information about EUD is already contained in UD.

Describe task again.

What is ELAS and EULAS  score.

Implement the function for the common case, and see how we fare on the
ELAS and EULAS  score.

Results in 2 lines:
- scores
- efficient
- transparent

\section{Method}


In essence, our method is to apply the recipes provided by TODO to
transform UD \emph{trees} into EUD graphs.

To do so, we use a tree-matching procedure against a UD tree, and
locally insert (and sometimes delete) edges. As a particular case, we
may re-label some edges.

Perhaps surprisingly, the patterns that we need to recognize are
pretty simple, involving only three nodes. The patterns are listed in
TODO.


match tree patterns which call for enhancing of the

dependency structure. We identify 2 types of paterns.

- deletion of arrows

\section{Discussion/Analysis}
(JP)

It works!

Labels work for english but not well for all languages.

Secondary hyp: EUD do not help for learning EUD.

We do not know about this YET. For this we'd need to use compare a
state of art UD implementation.


To test that we'd need to run our system on the \emph{training} data
of a state of the art EUD system and see how that affects its
performance. But we can't do it since such systems are not available
yet (this is the purpose of the task ...).

Also can be used for bootstrapping.
